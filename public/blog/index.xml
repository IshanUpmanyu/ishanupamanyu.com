      <description>In this blog post, we will create in Lucene Did you mean feature as seen in Google. Letâ€™s begin by understanding what this feature is.&#xA;Whenever you misspell a word in google, google is able to figure out that you made a mistake. If the mistake is not significant, then google simply shows results for what it thinks is the correct spelling. It also gives you the option to search instead for the original query you entered.</description>

I found myself getting more and more interested in learning how search engines like google and product search engines like Amazon search work. I started learning about information retrieval theory and gradually moved on to practical technologies like Apache Lucene and Apache Solr.</description>

      <description>Apache Lucene is a popular information retrieval library written in JAVA. It helps you add full-text search capability to your application. This library is at the heart of search servers like Elasticsearch and Apache Solr.&#xA;It was created in 1999 by Doug Cutting, who also created Apache Hadoop, and is now a top-level Apache Project.&#xA;You can use Apache Lucene to create your own search application which can include features like term matching, phrase matching, fuzzy search, proximity search, and much more.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how scoring in Elasticsearch is done?&#xA;Or you might be wondering why Solr ranked your results in a particular order.&#xA;Do you understand what happens under the hood? Both these systems use Apache Lucene internally. Now Lucene does scoring using a combination of Boolean Model on the inverted index and Vector Space Model.&#xA;In the previous article, we learned the Boolean model on an inverted index. It is used to shortlist documents that match our query.</description>
